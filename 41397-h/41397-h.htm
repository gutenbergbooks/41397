<h2><a name="A_Poet_of_the_People" id="A_Poet_of_the_People"></a>A Poet of the People</h2>


<p>Walt Mason's Prose Rhymes are read
daily by approximately ten million readers.</p>

<p>A newspaper service sells these rhymes
to two hundred newspapers with a combined daily
circulation of nearly five million, and assuming that
five people read each newspaper&mdash;which is the
number agreed upon by publicity experts&mdash;it may
be called a fair guess to say that two out of every
five readers of newspapers read Mr. Mason's poems.</p>

<p>So the ten million daily readers is a reasonably
accurate estimate. No other American verse-maker
has such a daily audience.</p>

<p>Walt Mason is, therefore, the Poet Laureate
of the American Democracy. He is the voice of
the people.</p>

<p>Put to a vote, Walt would be elected to the
Laureate's job, if he got a vote for each reader.
And, generally speaking, men would vote as they
read.</p>

<p>The reason Walt Mason has such a large
number of readers is because he says what the
average man is thinking so that the average man
can understand it.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Walt Mason is the philosophy
of America. Briefly it is this: The fiddler
must be paid; if you don't care to pay, don't
dance. In the meantime&mdash;grin and bear it, because
you've got to bear it, and you might as well grin.
But don't try to lie out of it. The Lord hates a
cheerful liar.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>This is what the American likes to hear. For
that is the American idea about the way the world is
put together. So he reads Walt Mason night and
morning and smiles and takes his knife and cuts
out the piece and carries it in his vest pocket, or
her handbag.</p>

<p>It will interest the ten million readers of Walt
Mason's rhymes to know that they are written in
Emporia, Kansas, in the office of the Emporia
Gazette, after Mr. Mason has done a day's work
as editorial writer and telegraph editor of an afternoon
paper. The rhymes are written on a
typewriter as rapidly as he would write if he were
turning out prose.</p>

<p>Day after day, year after year, the fountain flows.
There is no poison in it. And sometimes real
poetry comes welling up from this Pierian spring
at 517 Merchant street, Emporia, Kansas, U. S. A.</p>

<p>In the meantime we do not claim its medicinal
properties will cure everything. But it is good for
sore eyes; it cures the blues; it sweetens the temper,
cleanses the head, and aids the digestion. In cases
of heart trouble it has been known to unite torn
ligaments and encourage large families.</p>

<p>And a gentleman over there takes a bottle!
Step up quickly; remember we are merely introducing
this great natural remedy. Our supply
is limited. In a moment the music will begin.</p>

<p>Charles the First, with stately
walk, made the journey to the block.
As he paced the street along, silence
fell upon the throng; from that throng
there burst a sigh, for a king was come to
die! Charles upon the scaffold stood, in
his veins no craven blood; calm, serene, he
viewed the crowd, while the headsman said,
aloud: "Cheer up, Charlie! Smile and
sing! Death's a most delightful thing! I
will cure your hacking cough, when I chop
your headpiece off! Headache, toothache&mdash;they're
a bore! You will never have them
more! Cheer up, Charlie, dance and yell!
Here's the axe, and all is well! I, though
but a humble dub, represent the Sunshine
Club, and our motto is worth while: 'Do
Not Worry&mdash;Sing and Smile!' Therefore
let us both be gay, as we do our stunt today;
I to swing the shining axe, you to take
a few swift whacks. Lumpty-doodle, lumpty-ding,
do not worry, smile and sing!"</p>

<p>Singer of the kindly song, minstrel

dark and long, and beset with thorns
the way&mdash;in the poignant hour of pain, in
this weary worldly war, there is comfort in
thy strain, courage in "Excelsior." When
the city bends us down, with its weight of
bricks and tiles, lead us, poet, from the
town, to the fragrant forest aisles, where
the hemlocks ever moan, like old Druids
clad in green, as they sighed, when all
alone, wandered sad Evangeline. Writer
of the cleanly page, teacher of the golden
truth; still I love thee in my age, as I
loved thee in my youth. In some breasts
a fiercer fire flamed, than ever thou hast
known; but no mortal minstrel's lyre ever
gave a purer tone. Singer of the kindly
song, minstrel of the gentle lay, time is
swift and art is long, and thy fame will
last alway.</p>

<p>His days were joyous and serene, his
life was pure, his record clean; folks
named their children after him, and
he was in the social swim; ambitious lads
would say: "I plan to be just such a
worthy man!" But in the fullness of his
years, the tempter whispered in his ears,
and begged that he would make the race
for county judge, or some such place. And
so he yielded to his fate, and came forth
as a candidate. The night before election
day they found him lying, cold and gray,
the deadest man in all the land, this message
in his icy hand: "The papers that opposed
my race have brought me into deep
disgrace; I find that I'm a fiend unloosed;
I robbed a widow's chicken roost, and stole
an orphan's Easter egg, and swiped a soldier's
wooden leg. I bilked a heathen of
his joss, and later kidnapped Charlie Ross;
I learn, with something like alarm, that I
designed the Gunness farm, and also, with
excessive grief, that Black Hand cohorts
call me chief. I thought myself a decent
man, whose record all the world might
scan; but now, alas, too late! I see that all
the depths of infamy have soiled me with
their reeking shame, and so it's time to quit
the game."</p>

<h2><i>The
Human
Head</i></h2>


<p>The greatest gift the gods bestowed
on mortal was his dome of
thought; it sometimes seems a useless
load, when one is tired, and worn and hot;
it sometimes seems a trifling thing, less useful
than one's lungs or slats; a mere excuse,
it seems, to bring us duns from men
who deal in hats. Some men appreciate
their heads, and use them wisely every day,
and every passing minute sheds new
splendor on their upward way; while some
regard their heads as junk, mere idle knobs
upon their necks; such men are nearly always
sunk in failure, and are gloomy
wrecks. I know a clerk who's served his
time in one old store for twenty-years; he's
marked his fellows climb, and climb&mdash;and
marked with jealousy and tears; he's
labored there since he was young; he'll labor
there till he is dead; he never rose a
single rung, because he never used his head.
I know a poorhouse in the vale, where fifty-seven
paupers stay; they paw the air and
weep and wail, and cuss each other all the
day; and there they'll loll while life endures,
and there they'll die in pauper beds;
their chances were as good as yours&mdash;but
then they never used their heads. O human
head! Majestic box! O wondrous can,
from labels free! If man is craving fame
or rocks, he'll get them if he uses thee!</p>

<h2><i>The

<p>My cow's gone dry, my hens won't lay,
my horse has got the croup; the hot
winds spoiled my budding hay, and
I am in the soup. And while my life is sad
and sore, and earthly joys are few, I'll
write a note to Theodore; he'll tell me
what to do. I wasn't home when Fortune
called, my feet had strayed afar; I fear
that I am going bald, and I have got catarrh.
The wolf is howling at my door,
I've naught to smoke or chew; but I shall
write to Theodore&mdash;he'll tell me what to
do. My Sunday suit is old and sere, I'm
wearing last year's lids; my aunt is coming
for a year, to visit, with her kids. They
will not trust me at the store, and I am
feeling blue, so I shall write to Theodore&mdash;he'll
tell me what to do. When we are
weary and distraught, from worldly strife
and care, and we're denied the balm we
sought, and given black despair, ah, then,
my friends, there is one chore devolves on
me and you; we'll simply write to Theodore&mdash;he'll
tell us what to do.</p>

<p>She was sweet and soft and clinging,
and he always found her singing, when
he came home from his labors as the
night was closing in; she was languishing
and slender, and her eyes were deep and
tender, and he simply couldn't tell her that
her coffee was a sin. Golden hair her head
was crowning; she was fond of quoting
Browning, and she knew a hundred legends
of the olden, golden time; and her heart
was full of yearning for the Rosicrucian
learning, and he simply couldn't tell her
that the beefsteak was a crime. She was
posted on Pendennis, and she knew the
songs of Venice, and he listened to her
prattle with an effort to look pleased; and
she liked the wit of Weller&mdash;and he simply
couldn't tell her that the eggs he had for
breakfast had been laid by hens diseased.
So she filled his home with beauty, and she
did her wifely duty, did it as she understood
it, and her conscience didn't hurt,
when dyspepsia boldly sought him, and the
sexton came and got him, and his tortured
frame was buried 'neath a wagon-load of
dirt. O, those marriageable misses, thinking
life all love and kisses, mist and moonshine,
glint and glamour, stardust borrowed
from the skies! Man's a gross and sordid
lummix&mdash;men are largely made of stomachs,
and the songs of all the sirens will not
take the place of pies!</p>

<h2><i>The
Flag</i></h2>


<p>Bright-hued and beautiful, it
floats upon the summer air; and every
thread of it denotes the love that's
woven there; the love of veterans whose
tread has sounded on the fields of red; and
women old, who mourn their dead, but
mourn without despair. Bright-hued and
beautiful, it courts caresses of the breeze;
and, straining at its staff it sports, in flaunting
ecstasies; and other flags, that once were
gay, long, long ago were laid away, and
many men, whose heads are gray, are thinking
now of these. Serene and beautiful it
waves, the flag our fathers knew; in Freedom's
sunny air it laves, and gains a brighter
hue; and may it still the symbol be of all
that makes a nation free; still may we
cherish Liberty, and to our God be true.</p>

<h2><a name="Doc" id="Doc"></a><i>Doc
Jonnesco</i></h2>


<p>"O Doc," I cried, "I humbly beg,
that you will amputate my leg."
The doctor cheerfully complied,
and shot some dope into my hide, and made
his bucksaw fairly sail, until it struck a rusty
nail. "Hoot, mon!" he said, quite undismayed,
"I'll have to finish with a spade."
And as he dug and toiled away, we talked
about the price of hay, the recent frightful
rise in pork, the sugar grafters in New
York, the things we found in Christmas
socks, the flurry in Rock Island stocks, the
hookworm and the hangman's noose, the
bright career of Captain Loose. I felt no
pain or ache or shock; it pleased me much
to watch the doc; and when the job was
done, I said: "Now that you're here, cut
off my head." With skillful hands he
wrought and wrought, and soon cut off my
dome of thought, and when I asked him for
his bill: "There is no charge, already, still;
I work for Science, not for scads, so keep
the dollars of your dads; to banish pain is
my desire; to nothing more do I aspire; if
I may win that goal, you bet, I'll be so
happy, always, yet!" Is there a more heroic
game? Could any man have nobler aim?
One poet, old, and bald and fat, to this
great man takes off his hat!</p>

<p>Little girl, so glad and jolly,
playing with your home-made dolly,
built of rags and straw, fill the sunny
air with laughter, heedless of the sorrow
after&mdash;that is childhood's law! Let no sad
and sordid vision cheat you of the joy
Elysian that to youth belongs; let no prophecy
of sorrow scheduled for a sad tomorrow
still your joyous songs! Soon enough
will come the worry, and the labors, and the
hurry, soon you'll cook and scrub; soon with
milliners and drapers you will fuss, and
read long papers, at the Culture Club.
Lithe your form, but soon you'll force it
in a torture-chamber corset that will make
you bawl; and those little feet, that twinkle,
you will squeeze, until they wrinkle, into
shoes too small. And those sunny locks so
tangled will be tortured and kedangled into
waves and curls; and you'll buy complexion
powder, and your bonnets will be louder
than the other girl's. Little girl, with home-made
dolly, cut out woe and melancholy,
jump and sing and play! Fill the rippling
air with laughter! Tears and corns will
follow after! This is childhood's day!</p>

world o'er; "feed till you spavin us," thus
they implore; boarders are gluttonous,
roastbeef and muttonous; "come and unbutton
us, so we'll eat more!" Little they
pay me for chicken and rice; yet they waylay
me for dainties of price; "bring us
canary birds"&mdash;these are their very words,
bawling like hairy Kurds&mdash;"bring them on
ice!" I give them tea and toast, jelly and
jam, some kind of stew or roast, codfish or
ham; their words are Chaucerous: "Dame
Cup-and-Saucerous, bring us rhinoceros,
boiled with a yam!" I run a boarding

<p>At that hour supremely quiet,
when the dusk and darkness blend,

the screaming of the mart have died away,
then I like to lie a-dreaming of my castles

watered by the fabled streams, I would
travel starry spaces on the winged feet of
dreams; I would float across the ages to a
more heroic time, when inspired were all

<p>The king sat up on his jeweled
throne, and he heaved a sigh that was
like a groan, for his crown was hard,
and it bruised his head, and his scepter
weighed like a pig of lead; the ladies
smirked as they came to beg; the knights
were pulling the royal leg. The king exclaimed:
"If I had my wish, I would cut
this out, and I'd go and fish. For what is
pomp to a weary soul that yearns and yearns
for the fishing hole; the throne's a bore and
the crown a gawd, and I'd swap the lot for
a bamboo rod, and a can of worms and a
piece of string&mdash;but there's no such luck for
a poor old king!" And a boy who passed
by the palace high, to fish for trout in the
streamlet nigh, looked up in awe at the
massive walls, and caught a glimpse of the
marble halls, and he said to himself: "Oh,
hully chee! Wisht I was the king, and
the king was me! To reign all day with
your crown on straight is a whole lot better'n

of sod, and they are not long, and they are
not broad, but the soldiers have lots of
room; and the sod is part of the land they
saved, when the flag of the enemy darkly
waved, the symbol of dole and doom. The
little green tent is a thing divine; the little

you ought to go; and so you ask a
half day off, and you may have that same;
alas, that grannies always die when there's
a baseball game! Last spring, if I remember
right, three grandmas died for you, and
you bewailed the passing, then, of souls so
warm and true; and then another grandma
died&mdash;a tall and stately dame; the day they
buried her there was a fourteen-inning
game. And when the balmy breeze of June
among the willows sighed, another grandma
closed her eyes and crossed the Great
Divide; they laid her gently to her rest beside
the churchyard wall, the day we
lammed the stuffing from the Rubes from
Minnepaul. Go forth, my son, and mourn
your dead, and shed the scalding tear, and
lay a simple wreath upon your eighteenth
grandma's bier; while you perform this
solemn task I'll to the grandstand go, and
watch our pennant-winning team make
soupbones of the foe.</p>

<p>Sing a song of long ago, now the
weary day is done, and the breeze is
sighing low dirges for the vanished
sun; sing a song of other days, ere our
hearts were tired and old; sing the sweetest
of old lays: "Silver Threads Among the
Gold." We who feebly hold the track in
the gloaming of life's day, love the songs
that take us back to life's springtime, far
away, when our hope had airy wing, and
our hearts were strong and bold, and at eve
we used to sing "Silver Threads Among the
Gold." Then our hair no silver knew, and
these eyes, that shrunken seem, were the
brightest brown or blue, and old age was
but a dream; but the years have taken flight,
and life's evening bells are tolled; so, my
children, sing tonight, "Silver Threads
Among the Gold."</p>

<p>If old Jim Riley came to town,
to read a bundle of his rhyme, I guess
you couldn't hold me down&mdash;I'd want
to hear him every time. I wouldn't heed
the tempest's shriek; I'd walk ten miles and
not complain, to hear Jim Hoosier Riley
speak. But I would not go round a block
to see a statesman saw the air, to hear a
hired spellbinder talk, like a faker at the
county fair. For statesmen are as thick as
fleas, and poets, they are far between; one
song that lingers on the breeze is worth a
million yawps, I ween. If John McCutcheon
came to town, to make some pictures
on the wall, I'd tear the whole blamed
doorway down to be the first one in the
hall; you couldn't keep me in my bed if I
was dying there of croup; the push would
find me at the head of the procession, with
a whoop. But I won't push my fat old
frame across a dozen yards of bricks, to list
to men whose only fame is based on pull
and politics.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Penny" id="The_Penny"></a><i>The Penny

<p>It is wise to save the pennies when
the pennies come your way, for you're
more than apt to need them when arrives
the rainy day; and when Famine
comes a-whooping with the cross-bones on
her vest, then the fellow with the bundle
has the edge on all the rest. I admire the
man who's saving, if he doesn't save too
hard, if he doesn't think a dollar bigger
than the courthouse yard; and I like to see
him salting down the riches that he's struck,
if he always has a quarter for the guy that's
out of luck. When the winter comes upon
us, yelling like a baseball fan, then it's nice
to have some boodle in an old tomato can;
when there's sickness in the wigwam, and
we have to call the doc, then it's nice to have
a package hidden in the eight-day clock;
when Old Age, the hoary rascal, comes a-butting
in at last, then it's nice to have some
rubles that you cornered in the past; and
the man who saves the pennies is a dandy
and a duck&mdash;if he always has a quarter for
the guy that's out of luck.</p>

that your coming home at evening makes
your joyous subjects sing! So you read some
twenty chapters of old Gibbon's dope on
Rome, and you know what human bliss is
in your humble little home! There is really
nothing better in the way of earthly bliss,
than to toddle home at evening, and to get a
welcome kiss, and to know the kids who
greet you at the pea-green garden gate, have
been wailing, broken-hearted, that you were
two minutes late! There is nothing much
more soothing than a loving woman's smile,
when she sees your bow-legs climbing o'er

<p>The eagle ought to have a place

frolic in the sun? They'd be in jail for
larceny if justice should be done. They
are not half so good to eat as mallard duck
or grouse; they'd surely cause a panic in a
section boarding house; and never in this
weary world was farmer seen to go, to trade
a pail of eagle eggs for nails or calico. The
humble hen, on t'other hand, still helps the
world along; she lifts the farmer's mortgage
as she trills her morning song; she
yields the fragrant omelet, and when reduced
to pie, she makes the boarder feel
that he at last is fit to die. The eagle does
not stir the souls of earnest, thoughtful men;
and so let's take him from the shield and

never have been found, they flew

hair, some fourteen cubits high; it was the
half-back, lying there, where he had
crawled to die. They placed the pieces on
a door, and from the crimson field, that
hero then they gently bore, like soldier on
his shield. The surgeon toiled the livelong

ribs adjusted right, the wishbone and the

and got the spine in place, and fixed a gutta-percha

care, or does he know that they are there?
And can the tears of monarchs nine make
those dim eyes of Edward's shine? And if
they give their nine commands, can they
bring life to those cold hands? Can all
their armies and their ships bring laughter
to those dead white lips? Can their nine
crowns and sceptres nine, bring to the dead
the life divine? Nine paupers at a pauper's

<p>One day a farmer found a bone; he

it was a bone, and not a diamond or a stone,
he took it to an ancient sage, who said:
"In prehistoric age, this was the shin-bone
of a Thor-dineriomegantosaur-megopium-permastodon-letheriumsohelpmejohn."
The farmer cried: "Dad bing my eyes! Was
ever man so wondrous wise? He gazes on
a piece of bone, that I supposed to be a
stone, and, with a confidence sublime, he
looks across the void of time, and gives
this fossil bone a name, the fragment of
some creature's frame! To have such
knowledge, sir, as thine, I'd give those fertile
farms of mine." "Don't envy me," the

<h2><i>The
Wooden
Indian</i></h2>


<p>A poor old Wooden Indian, all
battered by the years, was seated on
a pile of junk, and shedding briny
tears. "What hurts you?" asked the Teddy
Bear, "why are you thus distressed? Why
do you tear your willow hair, and smite
your basswood breast?" "Alas, my occupation's
gone," the Indian replied; "cigar
men now refuse to keep red warriors outside;
I used to stand in pomp and pride before
a stogie store; but times have changed,
and those glad days will come to me no
more. I'm waiting here among the junk
in mournful solitude, till some one breaks
me into chunks to use for kindling wood."
"Cheer up!" exclaimed the Teddy Bear,
"don't break your heart, old sport! You
yet may have a chance to serve as juryman,
in court."</p>

<h2><a name="Home_and" id="Home_and"></a><i>Home and
Mother</i></h2>


<p>"What is Home Without a
Mother?" There's the motto on
the wall, hanging in a place obtrusive,
where it may be seen by all; and
the question's never answered&mdash;we can't
know what home would be, if its gentle
guardian angel in her place no more we'd
see. Mother washes all the dishes and she's
sweeping up the floors, while the girls are
in the parlor doing Paderewski chores;
mother's breaking up some kindling at the
woodpile by the gate, while the boys are
in the garden with their shovels, digging
bait; mother's on her knees a-scrubbing,
where the careless footprints are, while the
father sits in comfort, toiling at a bad cigar.
Mother sits with weary fingers, and with
bent and aching head, sewing, darning, for
the children while they're all asleep in bed;
mother's up before the sunrise, up to labor
and to moil, thinking ever of the others, in
the weary round of toil. What is home
without a mother? That we'll never realize
till the light of life has faded from the kind
and patient eyes; when the implements of
labor fall unheeded from her hand, and the
loving voice is silent&mdash;then, at last, we'll
understand.</p>

<h2><i>The

Four</i></h2>


<p>John and Peter, and Robert and
Paul, what in the world has become
of them all? How are they stacking,
and where are they gone&mdash;Paul and Robert
and Peter and John? Paul was a poet, and
labored and wrought over his harp, and he
kept its strings hot; haunting and sad was
his music, though sweet&mdash;bards can't be
glad when they've nothing to eat. Peter
made pictures and painted them well;
'twasn't his fault that they never would sell;
'twasn't his fault that he took a brief ride
out to the poorhouse, where later he died.
Robert taught school till he died of old age;
hard were his labors and scanty his wage;
we laid him to rest in a grave on the hill;
the county was called on to settle the bill.
John was a pitcher, whose curves were immense;
he was the pet of the bleachers, and
hence he was the owner of riches untold;
diamonds and rubies and sapphires and
gold. John and Peter and Robert and
Paul! Through the long years we've kept
cases on all!</p>

<h2><a name="Niagara" id="Niagara"></a><i>Niagara</i></h2>


<p>I gazed upon that mighty flood, that
writhed as though in pain or woe, and
fell with dull and sick'ning thud, into
the chasm far below. If there's a man with
soul so dead that he unmoved can view that
scene, he surely has a basswood head, and
had it carved when it was green. O noble
falls! Stupendous sight! Dame Nature's
most emphatic fact! The gods were on
their job all right when they designed that
cataract. All other wonders are a dream, a
foolish, feeble phantasy! The pauper falls
of Europe seem absurd when they're compared
with thee! Had I but seen thee in
thy prime, when this proud nation had its
dawn, in that fair, distant, golden time, before
they strapped thy harness on, then I'd
have written thee an ode, to make thy waters
pause a while; but go and drag along thy
load, since beasts of burden are in style.
Alas, that two such handsome falls, that
should be kicking up their heels, come forth
like horses from their stalls, to turn a million
greasy wheels! To grind up glue,
make lightning rods, and furnish cheap
electric light&mdash;no wonder that the nine great
gods look down in anger at the sight!</p>

<p>I hear the plashing of the rain upon
the roof, upon the pane, it murmurs
at the door; it patters forth a futile
boast; it whispers like a timid ghost; it
streams upon the floor. And as I sit me
here alone, and listen to its monotone,
strange fancies come and go; I seem to see,
distinct and plain dim faces drawn upon
the pane, of friends I used to know. Soft
voices whisper in the rain, and friends I
ne'er shall see again, are crying bitterly; the
raindrops seem to be their tears, and o'er
the misty void of years, they're calling, calling
me. O shadows from a starless shore,
begone, and torture me no more, and leave
me here alone! I fear the voices in the
rain, the voices vibrant with their pain&mdash;I
fear the spectres that complain, in weary
monotone! But still they chide me at the
door, and whisper there for evermore, and
murmur in their woe; I hear them in the
tempest's swell, I hear them sigh, I hear
them yell: "Where is that old green
umberell, you swiped two years ago?"</p>

<h2><i>The

<p>Every day we read the story of
some vessel tempest-tossed, which
sends forth a wireless message and
would otherwise be lost. It would join the
ghostly squadrons in the realm beneath the
wave, were it not for modern science, which
can rob the ocean grave. Vainly of such
mighty marvels&mdash;all in vain the poet sings!
They would need another Homer and a
harp with cast-iron strings! We can only
pause in wonder, as we read these thrilling
tales of the mystic spark that carries news
of shipwreck through the gales. We can
only take our lids off to the noble master
mind that achieved this latest triumph over
fog and wave and wind. Yet, to show appreciation,
we might buy some shares of
stock in the Wireless Corporation office,
just around the block. With each share
we'll get a picture of a Hero&mdash;maybe twins&mdash;and,
in time, in every parlor there will
hang a Johnnie Binns; there will be so
many Binnses, coming from the rescued
ships, that they'll form a secret order, with
its passwords, signs and grips.</p>

<h2><a name="Helpful" id="Helpful"></a><i>Helpful
Mr. Bok</i></h2>


<p>I owe so much to Mr. Bok that language
fails me when I try about his
kindnesses to talk, and briny tears bedim
my eye. I owe it to that gifted man
that I can take ten yards of string, and
decorate a frying pan until it is a beauteous
thing. He taught me how to paint a brick
and hang it on the parlor wall, which made
the blamed room look so slick that callers
cry: "It does beat all!" 'Twas Mr. Bok
who taught me how to tie pink ribbons on
my corns, and when I bought a muley cow,
he showed me how to gild her horns. I
made a cupboard from a trunk, directed by
his kindly charts; a cart-load of hand-painted
junk to my poor home a charm imparts.
When Arctic stories stirred the soul,
his enterprise was just immense; he showed
me how to make a pole complete for ninety-seven
cents. And when B. Tumbo sailed
away, among the roaring beasts to rush, Bok
pictured, in his L. H. J., a jungle made of
yellow plush. And when I face the tyrant
Death, may Bok be with me in the gloom,
to decorate my final breath, with tassels and
an ostrich plume.</p>

<h2><a name="Beryls" id="Beryls"></a><i>Beryl's
Boudoir</i></h2>


<p>She is a vain and foolish lass; she
stands before her looking-glass, and
fusses with her pins and rats, and
tries on half a dozen hats, and fixes doodads
in her hair, and tints her cheeks, already
fair. And when she's fooled three hours
away, and she appears, in glad array, she
isn't half as nice and neat, she isn't half as
slick and sweet as she appeared, four hours
ago, when she was wearing calico. If she
would take the time she fools away with
paints and curling tools, and read some
books, of prose or rhyme, she'd get some
value for her time. She pads her head outside
with rats, machine made hair and
monster hats; and gladness might with her
abide, if she would pad her head inside.
For beauty is a transient thing; the hurried
years are on the wing; the dazzling maiden
of today will soon be haggard, worn and
gray; and in life's winter, when she sits beside
her lonely hearth and knits, it will not
lessen her despair, to think of rats she used
to wear. But if her mind is stored with
gold from books the sages wrote of old, with
ancient lore or modern song, the days will
not seem drear and long; life's twilight will
be calm and fair, and loneliness will not be
there.</p>

<p>The mother, tired, with aching head,
from sweeping floors and baking
bread, called to her daughter: "Susan,
dear, I wish you'd help a little here."
Fair Susan, in the parlor dim, was playing
o'er a tender hymn; methinks it was "The
Maiden's Prayer"&mdash;a melody beyond compare.
She cried, while playing on, in style:
"I'll help you in a little while." Her
lover blew in unawares&mdash;a fine young man
with princely airs. His heart was free
from sordid stains; his head was full of
high-class brains; most any girl would give
her eyes to gather in so big a prize. He
heard the mother's weary cry; he heard the
damsel's flip reply. His bosom swelled
with noble ire! His tawny eyes flashed
streaks of fire! He cried: "Miss Susan
Sarah Brown, it's up to me to turn you

shine, you'll be no blushing bride of mine!
The healthy girl who doesn't jump, and on

the barbed kind of fun you are poking,
some fellow may carry in mind; and a good
many hearts have been broken, a good
many hearts fond and true, by words that
were carelessly spoken by alecky fellows

<h2><i>Knowledge
By Mail</i></h2>


<p>When I was young and fresh and
ruddy, and full of snap and vim,
my parents used to make me study
until my head would swim. I sat upon the
schoolhouse bleachers, with pencil, book
and slate, while sundry bald and weary
teachers drilled knowledge through my
pate. For some quick method I was yearning,
some easy path to tread; "there is no
royal road to learning," the bald old teachers
said; "stick closely to the printed pages,
all idleness eschew, and then, perhaps, in
future ages, you'll know a thing or two."
And when I left the school and college, to
climb life's toilsome hill, I found my little
store of knowledge would barely fill the
bill. But nowadays the world moves
quicker than in the long ago; old-fashioned
methods make us snicker, they were so
crude and slow. By sending seven wooden
dollars to Messrs. Freaks and Freaks, they'll
make our children finished scholars, and do
it in three weeks. So let us close the schools
and leave 'em to ruin and decay, and take
the books and maps and heave 'em a million
miles away; for now the kids take erudition
in three-grain capsule form; the
teacher loses the position that he so long
kept warm.</p>

And ere a year has run its course, the duke

will drop upon the marble floors, kerflop!
Samantha's cousin, Mary Ann, has hooked
up with the plumber man, a gent of industry

<h2><a name="The_Lost" id="The_Lost"></a><i>The Lost

<p>Upon the joyous New Year's day I
threw my briar pipe away. I said,
with conscious rectitude: "The
smoking habit's base and lewd; it taints the
breath and soils the teeth, and often stains
the chin beneath; the smoker's tongue is
badly seared, and he has clinkers in his
beard; of nicotine he is so full no self-respecting
cannibull would eat him raw, well
done or rare; and e'en his neckties and his
hair, his hat, his breath, and trouserloons,
suggest plug-cut and cuspitoons. And so I
throw my pipe away, upon this gladsome
New Year's day; my friends no more will
have to choke and wheeze in my tobacco
smoke." Since then the days drag slowly
on; it seems as though ten years have gone;
I walk the floor the long night through,
and, jealous, watch the kitchen flue&mdash;for it
can smoke and hold carouse, and not bust
forty-seven vows; the cookstove makes my
vitals gripe, for it can use its trusty pipe.
Thus far I've kept the vow I swore, but do

<h2><a name="Useless" id="Useless"></a><i>Useless
Griefs</i></h2>


<p>A hundred years ago and more,
men wrung their hands, and walked
the floor, and worried over this or
that, and thought their cares would squash
them flat. Where are those worried beings
now? The bearded goat and festive cow
eat grass above their mouldered bones, and
jay birds call, in strident tones. And where
the ills they worried o'er? Forgotten all,
for ever more. Gone all the sorrow and
the woe, that lived a hundred years ago!
The grief that makes you scream today,
like other griefs, will pass away; and when
you've cashed your little string, and jay
birds o'er your bosom sing, the stranger
pausing there to view the marble works that
cover you, will think upon the uselessness
of human worry and distress. So let the
worry business slide; live while you live,
and when you've died, the folks will say,
around your bier: "He made a hit while
he was here!"</p>

<h2><a name="Fairbanks" id="Fairbanks"></a><i>Fairbanks'
Whiskers</i></h2>

<p>Well may a startled nation
mourn, with wailings greet the
dawn, for Charlie's whiskers have
been shorn&mdash;another landmark gone! No
more, no more will robins nest within their
lilac shade, for they are folded now and
pressed, and with the mothballs laid. The
zephyrs that have sobbed and sighed
athwart that hangdown bunch, through
other whiskers now must glide; they'll
doubtless take the hunch. Vain world! This
life's an empty boast, and gods have feet of
clay; the things we love and honor most, are
first to pass away. The world seems new at
every dawn, seems new and queer, and
strange; and we can scarce keep tab upon
the ringing grooves of change. The changing
sea, the changing land, are speaking of
decay; "but Charlie's whiskers still will
stand," we used to fondly say; "long may
they dodge the glinting shears, and shining
snickersnees, and may they brave a thousand
years, the battle and the breeze! With
Charlie's whiskers in the van, we'll fight
and conquer yet, and show the world that
there's one man, who's not a suffragette!"
Vain dreams! Vain hopes! We now repine,
and snort, and sweat, and swear; for
Charlie's sluggers are in brine, and
Charlie's chin is bare.</p>

<p>He used to take a flowing bowl perhaps
three times a day; he needed it
to brace his nerves, or drive the
blues away, but as for chaps who drank
too much, they simply made him tired; "a
drink," he said, "when feeling tough, is
much to be desired; some men will never
quit the game while they can raise a bone,
but I can drink the old red booze, or let
the stuff alone." He toddled on the downward
path, and seedy grew his clothes, and
like a beacon in the night flamed forth his
bulbous nose; he lived on slaw and sweitzer
cheese, the free lunch brand of fruits, and
when he sought his downy couch he always
wore his boots; "some day I'll cut it out,"
he said; "my will is still my own, and I can
hit the old red booze, or let the stuff alone."
One night a prison surgeon sat by this poor
pilgrim's side, and told him that his time
had come to cross the great divide. "I've
known you since you were a lad," the stern
physician said, "and I have watched you as
you tried to paint the whole world red, and
if you wish, I'll have engraved upon your
churchyard stone: 'He, dying, proved that
he could let the old red booze alone.'"</p>

<p>Some day this heart will cease to
beat; some day these worn and weary
feet will tread the road no more; some
day this hand will drop the pen, and never
never write again those rhymes which are
a bore. And sometimes, when the stars
swing low, and mystic breezes come and go,
with music in their breath, I think of Destiny
and Fate, and try to calmly contemplate
this bogie men call Death. Such
thinking does not raise my hair; my cheerful
heart declines to scare or thump against
my vest; for Death, when all is said and
done, is but the dusk, at set of sun, the interval
of rest. But lines of sorrow mark my
brow when I consider that my frau, when
I have ceased to wink, will have to face a
crowd of gents who're selling cheap tin
monuments, and headstones made of zinc.
And crayon portrait sharks will come, and
make the house with language hum, and
ply their deadly game; they will enlarge
my photograph, attach a hand-made
epitaph, and put it in a frame. They'll hang
that horror on the wall, and then, when
neighbors come to call, they'll view my
crayon head, and wipe sad tears from either
eye, and lean against the chairs, and cry:
"How fortunate he's dead!"</p>

<h2><a name="The_Dying" id="The_Dying"></a><i>The Dying
Fisherman</i></h2>


<p>Once a fisherman was dying in his
humble, lowly cot, and the pastor sat
beside him saying things that hit the
spot, so that all his futile terrors left the
dying sinner's heart, and he said: "The
journey's lonely, but I'm ready for the
start. There is just one little matter that
is fretting me," he sighed, "and perhaps I'd
better tell it ere I cross the Great Divide. I
have got a string of stories that I've told
from day to day; stories of the fish I've captured,
and the ones that got away, and I fear
that when I tell them they are apt to stretch
a mile; and I wonder when I'm wafted to
that land that's free from guile, if they'll
let me tell my stories if I try to tell them
straight, or will angels lose their tempers
then, and chase me through the gate?"
Then the pastor sat and pondered, for the
question vexed him sore; never such a weird
conundrum had been sprung on him before.
Yet the courage of conviction moved
him soon to a reply, and he wished to fill
the fisher with fair visions of the sky: "You
can doubtless tell fish stories," said the
clergyman, aloud, "but I'd stretch them
very little if old Jonah's in the crowd."</p>

that George was scarcely in the game; that
grocers, butlers, clerks and cooks would
never read his helpful books, but blew
themselves for "Deadwood Dick," and
"Howling Hank from Bitter Creek," "The
Bandit That Nick Carter Caught," and

<h2><a name="The_Smart" id="The_Smart"></a><i>The Smart

<p>The other night I took a walk,
and called on Jinx, across the block.
The home of Jinx was full of boys
and girls and forty kinds of noise. Dad
Jinx was good, and kind, and straight; he
let the children go their gait; he never
spoke a sentence cross, he never showed that
he was boss, and so his home, as neighbors
know, was like the Ringling wild beast
show. We tried to talk about the crops;
the children raised their fiendish yawps;
they hunted up a Thomas cat, and placed
it in my stovepipe hat; they jarred me with
a carpet tack, and poured ice water down
my back; my long coat tails they set afire,
and this aroused my slumb'ring ire. I rose,
majestic in my wrath, and through those
children mowed a path, I smote them sorely,
hip and thigh, and piled them in the
woodshed nigh; I threw their father in the
well, and fired his cottage, with a yell.
Some rigid moralists, I hear, have said my
course was too severe, but their rebukes
can not affright&mdash;my conscience tells me I
was right.</p>

a struggle to the height, a futile search for
El Dorado, and then we say Good Night.
Some moiling in the strife and clangor,
some years of doubt and debt, some words
we spoke in foolish anger that we would
fain forget; some cheery words we said unthinking,
that made a sad heart light; the
banquet, with its feast and drinking&mdash;and
then we say Good Night. Some questioning
of creeds and theories, and judgment of
the dead, while God, who never sleeps or
wearies, is watching overhead; some little
laughing and some sighing, some sorrow,
some delight; a little music for the dying,
and then we say Good Night.</p>

<p>The maiden lingered in her bower,
within her fathers stately tower&mdash;it
was four hundred years ago&mdash;her
lover came, o'er cliff and scar, and twanged
the strings of his guitar, and sang his love
songs, soft and low. He said her breath was
like the breeze that wandered over flowery
leas, her cheeks were lovely as the rose; her
eyes were stars, from heaven torn, and she
was guiltless of a corn upon her sweet
angelic toes. For hours and hours his songs
were sung, until a puncture spoiled a lung,
and then of course he had to quit; but
Arabella from her room would shoot a smile
that lit the gloom, and gave him a conniption
fit. Then homeward would the lover
hie, as happy as an August fly upon a bald
man's shining head; and Arabella's heart
would swell with happiness too great to tell;
ah me, those good old times are dead! Just
let a modern lover scheme to win the damsel
of his dream by punching tunes from his
guitar! In silver tones she'd jeer and scoff;
she'd call to him: "Come off! come off!
where is your blooming motor car?"</p>

<p>My little dog dot is a sassy
pup, and I scold him in savage
tones, for he keeps the garden all
littered up with feathers and rags and bones.
He drags dead cats for a half a mile, and
sometimes a long-dead hen; and when I
have carted away the pile, he builds it all
up again. He howls for hours at the beaming
moon, and thinks it a Melba chore; and
neighbors who list to his throbbing tune,
rear up in the air and roar. And often I
hand down this stern decree: "This critter
will have to die." And he puts his paws on
my old fat knee, and turns up a loving eye;
and he wags his tail, and he seems to say:
"You're almost too fat to walk, and your
knees are sprung and your whiskers gray,
and your picture would stop a clock; some
other doggies might turn you down&mdash;some
dogs that are proud and grand, but you are
the best old boss in town; I love you to beat
the band!" And he bats his eye and he
wags his tail, conveying this kindly thought;
and I'd rather live out my days in jail, than
injure that derned dog Dot!</p>

<h2><a name="Harry" id="Harry"></a><i>Harry

<p>He's so familiar with the great,
this Harry Thurston Peck, that
every man of high estate has wept
upon his neck. The poet Browning pondered
deep the things that Harry said;
Lord Tennyson was wont to sleep in Harry's
cattle-shed. When Ibsen wrote, he wildly
cried: "My life will be a wreck, if this,
my drama, is denied, the praise of Thurston
Peck!" Said Kipling, in his better
days: "What use is my renown, since
Harry scans my blooming lays, and blights
them with a frown?" The poet, when his
end draws near, cries: "Death brings no
alarms, if I, in that grim hour of fear, may
die in Harry's arms." And, being dead,
his spirit knows no shade of doubt or gloom,
if Harry plants a little rose upon his humble
tomb. Poor Shakespeare and those elder
bards, who haunt the blessed isles, were
born too soon for such rewards as Harry
Thurston's smiles. But joy will lighten
their despair, and flood the realms of space,
for Harry Peck will join them there&mdash;they'll
see him face to face!</p>

<p>Now the long, long day is fading,

the stars begin parading, each one in
its distant sphere; and the city's strident
voices dwindle to a gentle hum, and the
heart of man rejoices that the hour of rest
has come. Thrown away is labor's fetter,
when the day has reached its close; nothing
in the world is better than a weary man's
repose. Nothing in the world is sweeter
than the sleep the toiler finds, while the
ravening moskeeter fusses at the window
blinds. Nothing 'neath the moon can wake
him, short of cannon cracker's roar; if you'd
rouse him you must shake him till you
dump him on the floor. Idle people seek
their couches, seek their beds to toss and
weep, for a demon on them crouches, driving
from their eyes the sleep. And the
weary hours they number, and they cry, in
tones distraught: "For a little wad of slumber,
I would give a house and lot!" When
the long, long day is dying, and you watch
the twinkling stars, knowing that you'll soon
be lying, sleeping like a train of cars, be,
then, thankful, without measure; be as
thankful as you can; you have nailed as
great a treasure as the gods have given

Alas, alas, poor careless jay! The lawyers

chair to pieces, but it didn't seem to soothe
me or to bring my soul relief; I have
stormed around the shanty till my wife and
maiden auntie said they'd pull their freight
and leave me full enjoyment of my grief. I
have made myself so pleasant that I'm quarantined

When there comes a big disaster, people

Death himself is good and kind; he always
does his best to soothe the heart that's sorrowful,
and give the weary rest; but there
are evils in his train that daunt the stoutest
soul, and one of them may serve to end this
cheerful rigmarole. I always have a haunting
dread that when I come to die, the

<h2><a name="The_Magic" id="The_Magic"></a><i>The Magic
Mirror</i></h2>


<p>I went one night with my high-priced
thirst to loaf in the booze bazar, and as
I sampled the old red dope I leaned
on the handsome bar. My purse was full
of the good long green, and my raiment was
smooth and new, and I looked as slick as a
cabbage rose that's kissed by the nice wet
dew. Behind the bottles a mirror stood,
as large as your parlor floor, and I looked
and looked in the shining glass, and wondered,
and looked some more. My own reflection
did not appear, but there where it
should have been, I saw the form of a cringing
bum all crumpled and soaked with gin.
His nose was red and his eyes were dim,
unshorn was his swollen face, and I thought
it queer such a seedy bo would come to so
smooth a place. I turned around for a better
look at this effigy of despair, and nearly
fell in a little heap, for the effigy wasn't
there! The barkeep laughed. "It's the
Magic Glass," he said, with a careless yawn;
"it shows a man how he's apt to look years
hence when his roll is gone!"</p>

<h2><a name="The_Misfit" id="The_Misfit"></a><i>The Misfit
Face</i></h2>


<p>A certain man, who lived some
place, was gifted with a misfit face;
when Nature built his mug she broke
all rules and tried to play a joke; of pale
red hair he had a thatch, his eyes were green
and didn't match; his nose was pug, his chin
was weak, and freckles grew on either
cheek, and sorrel whiskers fringed his chop,
too thin to ever make a crop. And people,
when they first beheld his countenance, just
stopped and yelled. But when they'd known
him for a while, and marked his glad and
genial smile; when passing time had made
them wise to all the kindness in those eyes;
and when they found that from his face
there came no sayings mean or base, that
misfit mug they'd often scan, and cry: "He
is a handsome man!"</p>

<h2><a name="A_Dog" id="A_Dog"></a><i>A Dog
Story</i></h2>


<p>A large black dog, of stately mien,
was walking o'er the village green,
on some important errand bent; a
little cur, not worth a cent, observed him
passing by, and growled, and barked a
while, and yapped, and howled. The big
one did not deign a look, but walked along,
like prince or dook. The cur remarked,
beneath its breath: "That big four-flusher's
scared to death! Those great big
brutes are never game; now just watch
Fido climb his frame!" The big black dog
went stalking on, as calm and tranquil as
the dawn; he knew the cur was at his heels;
he heard its yaps and snarls and squeals, and
yet he never looked around, or blinked an
eye, or made a sound; his meditations had a
tone that mangy pups have never known.
The cur, unnoticed, lost all fear; it grabbed
the big dog by the ear; the latter paused just
long enough to take the small one by the
scruff, and shake him gently to and fro; and
then he let poor Fido go, and said, in quiet
tones: "Now get!" And Fido's doubtless
running yet. Suppose you see if you can
nail the moral hidden in this tale.</p>

<h2><a name="Lions_and" id="Lions_and"></a><i>Lions and

<p>Once a hunter met a lion near
the hungry critter's lair, and the
way that lion mauled him was decidedly
unfair; but the hunter never
whimpered when the surgeons, with their
thread, sewed up forty-seven gashes in his
mutilated head; and he showed the scars
in triumph, and they gave him pleasant
fame, and he always blessed the lion that
had camped upon his frame. Once that
hunter, absent-minded, sat upon a hill of
ants, and about a million bit him, and you
should have seen him dance! And he used
up lots of language of a deep magenta tint,
and apostrophized the insects in a style unfit
to print. And it's thus with wordly
troubles; when the big ones come along, we
serenely go to meet them, feeling valiant,
bold and strong, but the weary little worries
with their poisoned stings and smarts,
put the lid upon our courage, make us gray,
and break our hearts.</p>

we only know that rest is sweet to weary

beneath the sod gave all they had to give to
God. And in the radiance of the Throne,
their names are known&mdash;their names are
known! We know not from what homes
they came; we can but guess their dreams
of fame; but lamps for them did vainly
burn, and mothers waited their return, and
listened, at some cottage door, for steps that
sounded never more; and loving eyes grew
dim with tears, and hearts grew old with
grief of years. And here they sleep, as they
have slept, since legions o'er the country

<p>When I hear a noble singer reeling

as a singer to excel, and I put my voice in

throughout the day, that I'll have Caruso
faded ere a month has rolled away. Then
the neighbors come and see me, and they
give me stern reproof, saying I am worse
than forty yellow cats upon the roof. When
I see a splendid painting it appeals to brain
and heart, and I blow myself for brushes
and decide to follow Art. With a can of
yellow ochre and a jug of turpentine, I produce
some masterpieces that would make
old Rubens pine, and I talk about Perspective
and the whatness of the whence, till a
neighbor comes and asks me what I'll take
to paint his fence. When I read a rattling

to write some chapters that will make
the nation think; and I rear some Vandyke

with a swollen grin: "Well, yes, he
licked me, that blamed ape! But I was

<p>I love the sun and the gentle breeze,
and the brook that winds through the

I love the trees, and I'm always glad when
I'm out of jail. We are governed now by
so many laws that liberty's dead, and we've
heard its knell, and the wise man carries a
set of saws, to cut his way from a prison
cell. The grocer wails in a dungeon deep,
for he sold an egg that was out of date;
the baker's fetters won't let him sleep, a
loaf of his bread was under weight. The
butcher beats at his prison door, and fills
the air with his doleful moan; they'll cut
off his head when the night is o'er, for he
sold a steak that was mostly bone. The
milkman's there in the prison yard, and the
jailers flog him and make him jump; it
seems to me that his fate is hard, though he
did draw milk from the old home pump.
A sickly weed, that was lank and thin, embellished
my lot, at the edge of town, and
the peelers nabbed me and ran me in, because
I neglected to cut it down. I dropped
a can as I crossed the park, and that is a
crime that's against the law; so they shut
me up in a dungeon dark, with its rusty
chains and its moldy straw. I love the
brook and the summer breeze, and I'm
rather mashed on the howling gale; and I'm
fond of robins and bumblebees, and I'm always
glad when I'm out of jail.</p>

<p>The hero of this simple tale was
born of parents beastly poor; they
toiled and wrought without avail to
scrape a living from the moor. Our hero
early made resolve that he would strive for
greater heights; "let others in these ruts
revolve, and carry on their puny fights; to
gather wealth, to live in state, is all that
makes this life worth while; and when I'm
grown I'll pull my freight, and try to raise
a mighty pile." His dreams came true, in
every way, as visions came, in days of old;
he took no time for rest or play, but gathered
in fat, yellow gold. By steady steps
our hero rose, to heights of usefulness and
fame; he put the kibosh on his foes, and
held the ace in every game. He laughed
at figtrees and at vines, and all domestic,
trifling things; he owned some railways and
some mines, and was among the copper
kings. But why detail his glories so? Why
should we try to count his dimes? It is
enough for us to know he's been indicted
twenty times.</p>

tired to get his labors done, all day he
loitered in the sun, and filled the air with
yawns and moans, while people called him
Lazybones. One day the doctor came, and
said: "Brace up, my friend! Hold up

asp, has got you in its loathsome grasp!
But I will break the hookworm lose, and
cook its everlasting goose! Swing wide your
mouth, and do not cringe&mdash;" and then he
took his big syringe, and shot about a quart
of dope, that tasted like a bar of soap, adown
the patient's yawning throat&mdash;"I guess I
got that hookworm's goat!" One gasping
breath the patient drew, and bit a lightning
rod in two, and vaulted o'er his cottage
roof; and then, on nimble, joyous hoof, he
sped across the windswept plain, and burned
a school, and robbed a train. The doctor
watched his patient streak across the landscape,
sere and bleak, and said: "It makes

<h2><a name="A_Near" id="A_Near"></a><i>A Near
Anthem</i></h2>


<p>My country, beauteous land! I'll sing,
if you will stand, a song to thee!
My harp is rather coarse, my voice
is somewhat hoarse, yet will I try to force
some melody. Fair land that saw my birth,
gem of the whole blamed earth, hark to my
screeds! Tell me, O tell me why prices
have soared so high that man can scarcely
buy things that he needs. Things that a
man must eat&mdash;lemons and prunes and
meat&mdash;cost like Sam Hill; carpets and rugs
and mats, neckties and shoes and hats, shirting
to hide his slats, empty his till. All
through the week I work, like an unlaundered
Turk, for a few bucks; no odds how
hard I try, of wealth I'm always shy, and
when I travel I ride on the trucks. They
say that half a plunk bought more and
better junk, in the old days, than will two
bones or more, in the big modern store,
since prices learned to soar, five hundred
ways. My country, hear my word! You
are a hummingbird, also a peach! Splendid
in peace and war, thou most effulgent star&mdash;tell
me why prices are clear out of reach!</p>

<h2><a name="The_Yellow" id="The_Yellow"></a><i>The Yellow
Cord</i></h2>


<p>When a tiresome Chinese statesman
bores his queen or overlord, he receives
a little package that contains
a yellow cord; and the statesman realizes
that it is no use to roar, so he hangs himself
in silence to the nearest sycamore. Let
us borrow from the wisdom of the rulers of
Cathay! Let us put this grand old custom
into common use today! Let the President
distribute samples of the saffron string, to
the statesmen who have bored us since the
early days of spring, with their figures and
statistics and their buncombe and hot air,
and their misfit oratory which won't lead
us anywhere. We might all, perhaps, be
rescued, from an ordeal that's abhorred, if
Big Bill would send the talkers twenty feet
of yellow cord!</p>

<h2><i>The
Important
Man</i></h2>


<p>You know the man of kingly air?
You run across him everywhere. He
seems to think his hat a crown; he
talks as though he handed down most all
the wisdom that the seers have gathered in
a thousand years. His dignity is most sublime;
to joke about him is a crime, and
when you meet him it is wise to lift your
hat and close your eyes; and it would please
him if you'd just lie down and grovel in the
dust. That is the wiser course, I say, but
I'm a feeble-minded jay, and when I meet
the swelled-up man, I jolly him the best
I can; I would to him the fact recall that
he's but mortal, after all. He's naught but
bones and legs and trunk, and lungs and
lights, and kindred junk; he breathes the
same old germy air that's breathed by
hoboes everywhere. And when he dies, as
die he must, he'll make as cheap a grade of
dust as any Richard Roe in town; the monument
that holds him down may tell his
glories for a while, but folks will read it
with a smile, and say: "That dead one must
have thought that he was Johnnie on the
spot, when he was on this earthly shore; I
never heard of him before."</p>

<h2><a name="Toddling" id="Toddling"></a><i>Toddling
Home</i></h2>


<p>A thousand cares oppress the
mind, in life's long summer day;
we weary of the galling grind, and
endless seems the way. The journey's really
not so long; we have not far to roam; and
soon we'll hear the evensong, and then we'll
toddle home. Our burdens seem an awful
pile, and yet they're not so great; if we
would pack them with a smile, we would
not feel the weight. We murmur as we
hold the plow, and guide it through the
loam; but dusk is coming, even now, and
soon we'll toddle home. We see a cloud of
sullen gray, and straightway we repine;
"the storm is rising fast," we say, "the sun
no more will shine." But in a space his
golden beams will light the azure dome,
until shall come the time for dreams, and
then we'll toddle home. No trouble lasts
if we are brave, and take a manly stand;
and Fear becomes a cringing slave, if we
but raise a hand; the evil that disturbs our
rest is but a shadow gnome; the sun is sinking
in the west, and soon we'll toddle home.
Then let us toddle home as gay as birds, that
never weep; as glad as children, tired of
play, who only wish to sleep; and while
Recording Angels write our names in heaven's
tome, we'll seek our couch, and say
good night when we have toddled home.</p>

<h2><a name="Trifling" id="Trifling"></a><i>Trifling
Things</i></h2>


<p>The Wise Man, with some boys in
tow, beheld a pin upon the ground.
"My lads," he said, his face aglow,
"come here and see what I have found!
'Tis but a pin, a humble pin, on which the
passing thousands tread, and some unthinking
men would grin, to see me lift it from
its bed. And yet, my lads, the trifles count;
the drops of water make the sea; the grains
of sand compose the mount, and moments
make eternity. Each hour to man its chances
brings, but he will gain no goodly store, if
he despises little things, nor sees the pin upon
his floor. I stoop and grasp this little
pin; I'll keep it, maybe, seven years; it yet
may let the sunshine in, and brighten up a
day of tears." The Wise Man bent to
reach the pin, and lost his balance, with a
yell; he hit the pavement with his chin; his
hat into the gutter fell; he rolled into a
crate of eggs, and filled the air with dismal
moans, and then a dray ran o'er his legs,
and broke about a gross of bones. They
took him home upon a door, and there he
moans&mdash;so tough he feels: "Those dad-blamed
children never more will listen to
my helpful spiels!"</p>

<h2><a name="Trusty" id="Trusty"></a><i>Trusty
Dobbin</i></h2>


<p>They doom you, Dobbin, now and
then, they say your usefulness is gone;
some blame fool thing designed by
men has put the equine race in pawn. They
doomed you, and your hopes were low,
when bicycles were all the rage; they said:
"The horse will have to go&mdash;he lags
superfl'ous on the stage!" They doomed
you when the auto-car was given its resplendent
birth. "Thus sinks the poor old
horse's star&mdash;he'll have to beat it from the
earth!" And now they're dooming you
some more, there are so many motor things;
men scorch the earth with sullen roar, or
float around on hardware wings. They
doom you, Dobbin, now and then, and call
you has-been, and the like; but while this
world is breeding men, the horse will still be
on the pike. No painted thing of cogs and
wheels and entrails made of noisy brass can
e'er supplant a horse's heels, or make man
grudge a horse his grass. No man-made
trap of bars and springs can love or confidence
impart, nor give the little neigh
that brings emotion to the horseman's heart.
O build your cars and ships and planes, and
doom old Dobbin as you will! While men
have souls and hearts and brains, old Dobbin
shall be with us still!</p>

<h2><a name="The_High" id="The_High"></a><i>The High
Prices</i></h2>


<p>At the hash-works where I board,
but one topic now prevails: "How
the price of grub has soared!"
Drearily the landlord wails. In his old,
accustomed place, he is sitting, at each meal;
sad and corpse-like is his face, as he carves
his ancient veal. When I ask that solemn
jay, if he'll pass the butter 'round, "butter
costs," I hear him say, "almost half a bone
a pound." When I want a slice of duck,
his expression is a sin; "this thin drake cost
me a buck, and the quacks were not thrown
in." Through the muddy coffee's steam, I
can hear him saying now: "I desired a
pint of cream, and they charged me for a
cow." "Let me have some beans," I cried&mdash;I
was hungry as could be; "sure!" he
wearily replied; "shall I give you two, or
three? Beans," he said, "long years ago,
of rank cheapness were the signs; now they
cost three scads a throw&mdash;and you do not
get the vines." Once, at morn, I wished
an egg, and the landlord had a swoon; with
his head soaked in a keg, he regained his
mind by noon; "once," he moaned, "an egg
was cheap; times have changed, alas! since
then; now the price would make you weep&mdash;and
they don't throw in the hen!"</p>

<p>It's all very well to be nursing a
grouch, when everything travels awry,
and you haven't the pieces-of-eight in
your pouch to pay for a cranberry pie; it's
all very well to use language galore, and
cover your whiskers with foam; you may
prance around town with a head that is sore&mdash;but
it's beastly to carry it home! You
may be discouraged and worn by the strife;
then make all your kicks on the street, for
the man who will wear out his grouch on
his wife, isn't fit for a cannibal's meat; if
troubles and worries are beating you down,
and bringing gray hairs to your dome, 'twill
do in the office to carry a frown, but it's
ghoulish to carry it home! The Lord, who
made sparrows and Katy H. Dids, loves the
man who is stalwart and brave, who cheerily
goes to his wife and his kids, though his
hopes may be fit for the grave; but the Lord
has no use for the twenty-cent skate, whose
courage is weak as the foam; who piles up
his sorrows, and shoulders the weight, and
carefully carries it home!</p>

<p>I'm glad I didn't find the Pole, up

brief day my wires were crossed; I said:
"Methinks I'd better go across the weary
wastes of snow, along the white bear's lonely
track, and find the Pole, and bring it
back. Thus shall I scale the heights of
fame, and grow sidewhiskers on my name.
I'll be a bigger man than Taft; I'll work the

I'll have some medals in my trunk, and
silver cups, and other junk; and kings and
queens will cry, with pride, that I'm all
wool and three yards wide. So let me hire
some Eskimos, and hit the nice cool Arctic
snows." But here my granny intervened,
and said: "Those stovepipes must be
cleaned; you haven't mowed the lawn this

there's something clogging up the flue&mdash;you
ought to wash the buggy, too, and there are

<h2><a name="Wilbur" id="Wilbur"></a><i>Wilbur

<p>He's won success where others
failed; he's built a weird machine,
composed of cranks and doodads
and propelled by gasoline, that circles
proudly overhead, as graceful in its flight,
as any eagle that cavorts along the airy
height. When Wilbur and his brother bold
began their march to fame, the sages of the
village sneered, and said: "What is their
game? Do these here loonies really think
that they can make a trap of iron and brass
and canvas things, and junk and other
scrap, with which to leave the solid earth,
and plow the atmosphere? By jings! It
isn't safe for them to be at large, that's
clear." But Wilbur and his brother bold,
whose courage never fails, kept on a-patching
up their trap with wire and tin and
nails, they built a new cafoozelum, improved
the rinktyram, and tinkered up the
doodlewhang until it wouldn't jam; and
then one morning up they flew, and all the
village seers just stood around and pawed
the ground and chewed each other's ears.
Good luck be with those Dayton boys&mdash;good
luck in every flight! It is a pleasant rite to
write that Wright is strictly right!</p>

gone to bed, and turned to the wall and
died. But it's you for the long, long weary
trail, o'er the hills and the desert sand, by
the side of the bones of the steeds that fail
and perish on either hand. It's you for the
steady and tireless lope, through canyon or
mountain pass; to be flogged at night with
a length of rope, and be fed on a bunch of
grass.</p>

<h2><a name="Schuberts" id="Schuberts"></a><i>Schubert's
Serenade</i></h2>


<p>There is no tune that grips my heart,
and seems to pull me all apart, like
this old Serenade; it seems to breathe
of distant lands, and orange groves and
silver sands, and troubadour and maid. It's
freighted with a gentle woe as old as all
the seas that flow, as young as yesterday;
as changeless as the stars above, as yearning
as a woman's love for true knight far
away. It seems a prayer, serene and pure;
a tale of love that will endure when they
who loved are dust, when earthly songs are
heard no more, and bridal wreaths are withered
sore, and wedding rings are rust. It's
weary with a lover's care; it's wailing with
a deep despair, that only lovers learn; and
yet through all its sadness grope the singing
messengers of hope for joys that will
return. O, gentle, soothing Serenade!
When I am beaten down and frayed, with
all my hopes in pawn, when I've forgotten
how to laugh, I wind up my old phonograph,
and turn the music on! And then I
float away, away, to moonlit castles in
Cathay, or Araby or Spain, and underneath
the glowing skies I read of love in damsels'
eyes, and dream, and dream again!</p>

<h2><i>The
Tightwad</i></h2>


<p>The Tightwad is a pleasant soul
who freezes strongly to his roll, until
he hasn't any; his bundle colors all
his dreams, and when awake he's full of
schemes to nail another penny. He counts
his roubles day by day, and when a nickel
gets away, it nearly drives him dotty; he
grovels to the man of biz who has a bigger
roll than his, and to the poor he's haughty.
All things upon this earth are trash that
can't be bought or sold for cash, in Tightwad's
estimation; the summer breeze, because
it turns the cranks of mills and pumps
and churns, receives his toleration; the sun
is useful in its way; it nourishes the wheat
and hay&mdash;so let the world be sunny; he likes
to hear the raindrops slosh; they help the
pumpkin, beet and squash, and such things
sell for money. The tightwad often is a
bear around his home, and everywhere, and
people hate or fear him; since kindness has
no market price, it's waste of effort to be
nice to victims who are near him. Methinks
that when the tightwad dies, and to
his retribution flies, his sentence will be
funny; they'll load him with a silver hat,
and boil him in a golden vat, and feed him
red-hot money!</p>

fare, he went out doors with his
trusty club, and slaughtered the nearest
bear; and thus he avoided the butcher's fake
of selling a pound of bone, and charging it
up as the sirloin steak that you ordered by
telephone. The cave man wore, as his Sunday
best, the skin of a sheep or goat, and a
peck of whiskers on his breast, in lieu of a
vest or coat; so he nothing knew of the
tailor's knack of sewing a vest all wrong,
and making a coat with a crooked back, and
the pants half a foot too long. The cave
man swallowed his victuals raw, as he sat
on his nice mud floor; and his only tool was
his faithful jaw, and he wanted for nothing
more. He took his drinks at the babbling
brook, and healthy and gay was he; and he
never swore at the bungling cook for spoiling
the pie or tea.</p>

<h2><a name="Rudyard" id="Rudyard"></a><i>Rudyard
Kipling</i></h2>


<p>Alas for R. Kipling! When he
was a stripling, and filled with the
fire of his age, he looked like a dinger&mdash;the
all-firedest singer that ever wrote
rhymes by the page. His harpstrings he
pounded with vim till they sounded like
strains of a Homeric brand, and people, in
wonder, inquired who in thunder was filling
with music the land. "At last&mdash;now we
know it&mdash;the world has a poet, who'll set
all the rivers afire," in this way we hailed
him, when critics assailed him, and knocked
on his bargain sale lyre. The years have
been flying, and old bards are dying, and
some of the young have been called; and
Rudyard the rhymer is now an old timer,
string-halted and painfully bald. And
harder and harder, with counterfeit ardor,
he whangs at his lusty old lyre; it's kept
caterwauling and wailing and squalling,
when it ought to be flung in the fire. O
hush up its clangor! In sorrow, not anger,
we proffer this little request; let's think of
the stripling&mdash;the long vanished Kipling,
and let the old man take a rest.</p>

<h2><i>In

<p>That Hoosier country's most
prolific of folks who scale the heights
of fame; excelling in the arts pacific,
they give their state a lustrous name. There
old Jim Riley writes his verses, and wears,
without dispute, the bays; George Ade must
pack around six purses to hold the dough
he gets for plays. Booth Tarkington is fat
and wheezy, from dining on the market's
best; he's living on the street called Easy,
and gives his faculties a rest. Abe Martin
also is a Hoosier, and hands out capsules
good to see; and when you take 'em you
will lose your suspender buttons in your
glee. And Nicholson and many others are
writing stuff that hits the spot; O, surely
Indiana mothers a most unique and gifted
lot! And I've received a little volume, concerning
Indiana's crops; it gives the figures,
page and column, and rambles on and never
stops. It gives the yield of sweet potatoes,
and corn and wheat and pigs and eggs, and
cabbages and green tomatoes, and sauer
kraut packed in wooden kegs. And never
once in all the story are any of those writers
named; poor Indiana's truest glory is
missed&mdash;she ought to be ashamed.</p>

<h2><a name="At_The" id="At_The"></a><i>At The
Theatre</i></h2>


<p>I went last night to see the play&mdash;a
drama of the modern kind; and I am
feeling tired today; I'd like to fumigate
my mind. I'd hate to always recollect those
tawdry jokes and vicious cracks; for I
would fain be circumspect, and keep my
brain as clean as wax. The playwright did
his best to show that married life is flat and
stale; that homely virtues are too slow to
prosper in this earthly vale; he put Deceit
on dress parade, and put a laurel crown on
Vice; and Honor saw her trophies fade, and
Truth was laid upon the ice. "It held the
mirror up to life," and I, who saw it, homeward
went, and got a club and beat my
wife, and robbed an orphan of a cent. If I
saw many plays so rank, so full of dark and
evil thought, I'd steal a blind man's savings
bank, or swipe a widow's house and lot.
You may be lustrous as a star, with all the
virtues in you canned, but if you fool around
with tar you'll blacken up to beat the band.
You may be wholesome as the breeze that
chortles through a country lane, but if you
eat Limburger cheese, your friends will pass
you with disdain. And every time you see
a play, or read a book that makes a jest of
love and home you throw away some part
of you that was the best.</p>

<p>Now my wife is reading papers on
the Fall of Ancient Rome, and I find
myself, her husband, doing all the
work at home; I have washed the dinner
dishes, I have swept the kitchen floor, and
I've pretty near decided that I'll do it never
more. For the soap gets in my whiskers
and the grease gets on my clothes, and I'm
always dropping dishes and big sadirons on
my toes; and I cannot herd the children
while I'm scrubbing, very well, two have
vanished in the distance, three have fallen
in the well; and I'm always using coal oil
where I should use gasoline, so the stove is
blown to pieces, and the roof has holes, I
ween. And the neighbors come and chaff
me, laugh like horses at the door, as I slop
around in sorrow, wiping gravy from the
floor. So methinks I'll ask the missus after
this to run our home, and I'll do a stunt of
reading papers on the Fall of Rome.</p>

with them I frolicked round and round,
and drank with them red lemonade; and
life seemed very full and sweet, as joyous
as the song of larks, until a guy got on his
feet, and said he'd make a few remarks.
I journeyed to the county fair, to view the
products of the farm; I marveled at the
pumpkins there, and carrots longer than
your arm; and happiness was over all, there
was no sign of care that carks, until a man,
with lots of gall, got up to make a few remarks.
Oh, I was born for joy and glee,
to sing as blithely as the birds! My life,
that should so sunny be, is darkened by a
cloud of words; and when my prospects
seem most fair, and trouble for its bourne
embarks, some Windy Jim is always there,
to rise and make a few remarks.</p>

<p>When the home team loses a well

but nothing is ever gained, my

to let him fade away, and die of his
soul's remorse, than to muss the diamond
with his remains, or sit on his pulseless
corpse. When I was younger I always
slew the umpire whose work was bum, and
now when I go to my downy couch, the
ghosts of the umpires come, and moan and
gibber around my bed and rattle their fleshless
bones, and call me names of the rankest
kind, in their deep, sepulchral tones. I
always found, when an umpire died, and
rode in the village hearse, that the fellow
who came to take his place was sure to be
ten times worse.</p>

<p>The Great Detective had returned;
he'd been some years away, and I supposed
that he was dead, and sleeping
'neath the clay. Ah, ne'er shall I forget
the joy it gave me thus to greet the king
of all detectives in my rooms in Baker
street! "I notice, Watson," Sherlock said,
with smile serene and wide, "that since I
left you, months ago, you've found yourself
a bride." I had not spoken of the fact,
so how did Sherlock know? I tumbled
from my rockingchair, his knowledge
jarred me so. "It's easy, Watson," said the
sleuth; "deduction makes it plain; you ate
an egg for breakfast and your chin still
wears the stain; you haven't shaved for half
a week&mdash;the stubble's growing blue&mdash;your
pants are baggy at the knees, your necktie's
on askew; your vest is buttoned crooked
and your shirt is out of plumb; your hat

gum. You were something of a dandy in
the good old days of yore&mdash;pass the dope,

<h2><i>The
Sanctuary</i></h2>


<p>I do not like the man who searches
his mind for caustic things to say, about
the preachers and the churches; he
grows more common every day. The cynic
is a scurvy tutor, whose head and creed are
made of wood; he puts up little gods of
pewter, and says that they "are just as
good." He thinks that triumphs he is winning,
and he emits a joyous laugh, if he can
knock the underpinning from Faith, that is
our rod and staff. He is a poor and tawdry
victor, who would o'er dead religions walk;
the church still lives, though fools have
kicked her, since first she builded on a rock.
I hear the mellow church bells ringing a
welcome to that calm retreat; I hear the
choir's sweet voices singing an anthem, reverent
and sweet. And well I know the
gentle pastor is pointing out the path to
wend, and urging men to let the Master be
evermore their guide and friend. And he,
like all good men, is reaching for better,
and for higher things; and so the message
of his preaching&mdash;unlike the cynic's&mdash;comfort
brings.</p>

<h2><i>The

<p>Beneath the stones they sweetly
sleep, the humble toilers of the press,
no more to sorrow or to weep, no
more to labor in distress. Here lies a youth
upon whose tomb the tear of pity often
drops; we had to send him to his doom, because
he wrote of "bumper crops." Here
sleeps the golden years away the fairest of
the human tribe; we slew him at the break
of day, because he called himself "ye
scribe." Beneath that yew another sleeps,
who did his work with smiling lips; we
had to put him out for keeps when he referred
to "flying trips." And one, the
noblest of them all, is resting on the windswept
hill; in writing up a game of ball,
he spoke of one who "hit the pill." Hard
by the wall, where roses bloom, and breezes
sway the clinging vines, that youth is sleeping
in his tomb, who used the phrase, "along
these lines." Today the sexton wields his
spade, and digs a grave both deep and wide,
where soon the stripling will be laid, who
wrote about "the blushing bride."</p>

which I watched him grind; and
oft he cried, as in despair: "Please
help me&mdash;I am blind!" I muttered, as his
music rose: "He plays in frightful luck!"
And then I went down in my clothes, and
gave him half a buck. A friend came rushing
up just then, and said: "You make me
ache! You are the easiest of men&mdash;that beggar
is a fake! The fraud has money salted
down&mdash;more than you'll ever earn; he owns
a business block in town, and he has farms
to burn." I answered: "Though the beggar
own a bankroll large and fat, I don't regret
the half a bone I threw into his hat.
I see a man who looks as though the world
had used him bad; it sets my jaded heart
aglow to give him half a scad. And though
that beggar man may be the worst old fraud
about, that makes no sort of odds to me;
that isn't my lookout. I'll stake Tom,
Harry, Dick or Jack, whene'er he comes
my way; my conscience pats me on the
back, and says that I'm O. K. But if a
busted pilgrim came to work me, in distress,
and I inquired his age and name, his
pastor's street address, and asked to see the
documents to prove he told no lies, before
I loosened up ten cents, my conscience
would arise and prod me till I couldn't
sleep, or eat a grown man's meal; and so
the beggar man may keep that section of a

<p>The railway station in our town

gather there to meet each train. The waiting
room is bleak and bare, a place of never-ending
din; yet fifty loafers gather there
each day to see the train come in. The station
agent's life is sad; the loafers made it
grim and gray; they drive the poor man
nearly mad, for they are always in the way.
The passengers can only sob as they their
townward way begin, for they must struggle
through the mob that's there to see the
train come in. The men who have their
work to do are hindered in a hundred ways;
in vain they weep and cry out "Shoo!" they
can't disperse the loafing jays. These loafers
always are the same; they toil not, neither
do they spin; they have no other end or
aim, than just to see the train come in.
I've traveled east, I've traveled west,
and every station in the land appears to
have its loaferfest, its lazy, idle, useless
band; I know the station loafer well;
he has red stubble on his chin; he has an

<p>He toiled and sweated half his life
to hang rich garments on his wife.
"I haven't time to cut a dash," he
said, "but I will blow the cash to let those
swelled-up neighbors know that I have got
the cash to blow." And so his good wife
wore her furs, and dress parade was always

on my back&mdash;and have you with me as of
yore&mdash;than all the sables in the store! And
if you really love your wife, you'll get back
to the simple life. Don't try to gather all
the dough that's minted in this world below;
just earn enough to pay the freight,
and let us live in simple state, in some neat
shanty far away from pomp and fuss and
vain display&mdash;some hut among the cockleburs,
remote from jewelry and furs!"</p>

<h2><a name="Halloween" id="Halloween"></a><i>Hallowe'en</i></h2>


<p>Tonight the boys will take the town,
and doubtless turn it upside down;
they'll sport around with joyous zest,
and knock the landscape galley west; and
when the morning comes I'll see my buggy
in an apple tree; the sidewalk piled upon
the lawn, the hens with all their feathers
gone; I'll hear my trusty milkcow yell down
at the bottom of the well, while Dobbin
stands upon the roof and waves for help a
frantic hoof. Last year the boys wrought
while I slept, and in the morn I screamed
and wept, when looking at the work they'd
done, I said: "Next year I'll get a gun, and
watch for these michievous souls, and shoot
the darlings full of holes." But granny
heard me, and she said: "While water's
cheap, go soak your head; you once were
young yourself, by George! and people
voted you a scourge; you played so many
fiendish tricks, you filled so many hats with
bricks, that terror came to every one when
you went forth to have some fun. The
village pastor used to say: 'When that
young rascal comes my way, I always beat
a swift retreat&mdash;I'd rather have the prickly
heat!'" And so I haven't bought a gun;
and so the boys may have their fun; and if
the morning should disclose the chimney
filled with garden hose, the watchdog
painted green and brown, the henhouse
standing upside down, I'll make no melancholy
noise, but say: "Boys (durn 'em!)
will be boys!"</p>

to the
Romans</i></h2>


<p>He stood erect, and having seen
that artists for some magazine had
sketched him in his proper pose, he
cleared his throat, and blew his nose, and
said: "Hi, Romans, you are slaves! You've
not the price to buy your shaves! The good
old sun's still on the turf, and his last beam
falls on a serf! Great Scott, my friends, is
freedom dead? O whence and whither do
we tread? I view the future with alarm!
We tremble 'neath the tyrant's arm, and
ye may tremble, sons of Rome, until the
muley cows come home, but you will still
be in the hole, unless some fiery, dauntless
soul, like me, shall lead you from the wreck,
and soak the tyrant in the neck! And here
I stand to cut the ice! I'm ready for the
sacrifice! I'll save you, if a Roman can!
As candidate for councilman, I ask your
votes, and if I win I'll swat the tyrant on
the chin. I'll represent the fourteenth
ward, and represent it good and hard, and
drive the grafters from their place, and
kick the tyrant in the face! Corruption in
our Rome will die, if you'll support your
Uncle Ri!"</p>

<h2><a name="The_Sorrel" id="The_Sorrel"></a><i>The Sorrel
Colt</i></h2>


<p>A sorrel colt, one pleasant day,
ran round and round a stack of hay,
and kicked its heels, and pawed the
land, and reared and jumped to beat the
band. The older horses stood around and
swallowed fodder by the pound, and gave
no notice to the kid that gaily round the
haystack slid. I loafed along and murmured,
then: "If horses were as mean as
men, some old gray workhorse, stiff and
sour, would jaw that colt for half an hour;
methinks I hear that workhorse say: 'You
think you're mighty smooth and gay, and
you are fresh and sporty now, but when
they hitch you to the plow, and strap a harness
on your back, and work you till your
innards crack, and kick you when you want
to balk, and slug you with a chunk of rock,
and cover you with nasty sores, and leave
you freezing out of doors&mdash;O, then you
won't kick up your heels! You'll know,
then, how a workhorse feels!' But horses
have no croaking voice, to chill the colt that
would rejoice; no graybeard plug will leave
its feed to make the heart of childhood
bleed; no dismal prophecies are heard, no
moral homilies absurd, where horses stand
and eat their hay, and so the colts may run
and play!"</p>

Yet I'm always gay and snug, happy as a

grinding out my blame fool rhymes! Old
John D., on t'other hand, frets away to beat
the band; he is burdened with his care&mdash;though
he isn't with his hair&mdash;and his health
is going back, and his liver's out of whack,
and his conscience has grown numb, and his
wishbone's out of plumb, and he's trembling

<p>I bought me a suit of the Sears-buck

and sewed by hand; they said it was
woven of finest wool, and couldn't be torn
by an angry bull; they said it was fine, and
would surely last, till Gabriel tooteth the
final blast. It was ten cents cheaper than
suits I'd bought, from local dealers, who
seemed quite hot, and shed a bucket of
briny tears, when I bought my clothes of
the Sawbuck Rears. I wore that suit when
the day was damp, and it shrunk to the size
of a postage stamp; the coat split up and
the vest split down and I scared the horses
all over town, for the buttons popped and
the seams they tore, and the stiches gave,
with a sullen roar. And I gave that suit
to a maiden small, who found it handy to
dress her doll.</p>

<h2><i>The
Cussing
Habit</i></h2>


<p>The jackal is a beastly beast; and
when it hankers for a feast, it has no
use for nice fresh meat; the all-fired
fool would rather eat some animal that died
last year; and so the jackal, far and near, is
shunned by self-respecting brutes, and
slugged with rocks, and bricks, and boots.
And men whose language is decayed, who
make profanity a trade, are like the jackal
of the wild, that hunts around for things
defiled. In all your rounds you'll never
find a healthy, clean and gentle mind possessed
by any son of wrath whose language
needs a Turkish bath. On great occasions
there's excuse for turning ring-tailed cuss-words
loose; the Father of his Country
swore at Monmouth, and then cussed some
more; that patient soul, the Man of Uz,
with boils so thick he couldn't buzz, ripped
off some language rich and brown, until old
Bildad called him down. Great men, beneath
some awful stroke let loose remarks
that fairly smoke, and we forgive them as
we write the story of their deeds of might.
But little men, who swear, and swear, and
thus pollute our common air, are foul and
foolish as the frogs that trumpet in their
native bogs.</p>

cries, in sorrow: "Blawst my blooming

These once progressive British isles are left
behind a million miles; it was a blamed
Italian chap that made that wireless message

o'er the land&mdash;a voice John Bull can understand;

<p>We're making laws, with lots
of noise, to keep from harm our
precious boys. The curfew bell
booms out at eight, and warns the lads to
pull their freight for home and bed and
balmy sleep, while wary cops their vigils
keep. The cheap toy pistol's down and out;
we won't have things like that about; and
boys who'd hear the pistol's toot must sit
and watch their parents shoot. The cigarette
at last is canned; the children of this
happy land can buy such coffin-nails no
more, which sometimes makes the darlings
sore. Each year new laws and statutes
brings, to shield them from corrupting
things. It's strange that we should overlook
the screaming blood-and-thunder book,
the wild and wooly, red-hot yarn, that
Johnnie reads behind the barn. The tales
of bandits who have slain a cord of men,
and robbed a train; of thieves who break
away from jail, with punk detectives on
their trail; of long haired scouts and men
of wrath who nothing fear&mdash;except a bath.
Such yarns as these our Johnnie reads; they
brace him up for bloody deeds; and when
he can he takes the trail, and ends his bright
career in jail. So, while we're swatting
evil things, and putting little boys on wings,
let's swat the book that leaves a stain upon
the reader's soul and brain.</p>

<h2><i>The
Traveler</i></h2>


<p>He had journeyed, sore and weary,
over deserts wide and dreary;
through the snows of far Sibery he
had dragged his frozen form; he had
searched the site of Eden, been through
Kansas, wild and bleedin'; in the far-off
hills of Sweden he had faced the winter
storm. In the vain pursuit of glory, hoping
he would live in story, he had hoofed it to
Empory, from Toronto on the lake; he had
heard land agents rattle through the
suburbs of Seattle, he had seen the Creek
of Battle, where they live on sawdust cake.
Fate was kind, and just to prove her he had
journeyed to Vancouver, where the emigrant
and mover pitch their tents upon the
street; he had roamed the broad Savannah,
he had voted in Montana; hunting with
the mighty Bwana, Afric's jungles knew
his feet. He had sung the boomer's ditty
down in Oklahoma City, thinking it a
blooming pity that the town had such a
name; he had mined in cold Alaska, farmed
with Bryan in Nebraska, and was never
known to ask a least advantage in the game.
To his native town returning, all reporters
there were yearning to receive a statement
burning, from this calm intrepid soul; not
of fights or sieges gory was the hero's simple
story; "I have but one claim to glory&mdash;I
have never found the Pole!"</p>

at a five-cent torch, while the good wife

gambol around outdoors. The Old
Man sits on his work-day hat, and he
doesn't envy the plutocrat; his debts are
paid and he owns his place, and he'll look
a king in the blooming face; his hands are
hard with the brick and loam, but his heart
is soft with the love of home! Saturday
night, and it's time for bed! And the kids
come in with a buoyant tread; and they
hush their noise at the mother's look, as she
slowly opens a heavy book, and reads the
tale of the stormy sea, and the voice that
quieted Galilee. Then away to bed and
the calm repose that only honesty ever
knows. Saturday night, and the world is
still, and it's only the erring who finds
things ill; there is sweet content and a
sweeter rest, where a good heart beats in a
brave man's breast.</p>

<h2><a name="Lady" id="Lady"></a><i>Lady
Nicotine</i></h2>


<p>Smoking is a filthy habit, and a big,
fat, black cigar advertises that you're
straying from the Higher Life afar.
I have walked in summer meadows where
the sunbeams flashed and broke, and I never
saw the horses or the sheep or cattle smoke;
I have watched the birds, with wonder,
when the world with dew was wet, and I
never saw a robin puffing at a cigarette; I
have fished in many rivers when the sucker
crop was ripe, and I never saw a catfish
pulling at a briar pipe. Man's the only living
creature that parades this vale of tears,
like a blooming traction engine, blowing
smoke from mouth and ears. If Dame
Nature had intended, when she first invented
man, that he'd smoke, she would
have built him on a widely diff'rent plan;
she'd have fixed him with a damper and a
stovepipe and a grate; he'd have had a
smoke consumer that was strictly up-to-date.
Therefore, let the erring mortal put his
noisome pipe in soak&mdash;he can always get a
new one if he feels he needs a smoke.</p>

that is sure for ever more; the consumer

a lover who is surely making good, who is
winning admiration, who is sawing lots of

quoth I, "when day is dead, methinks you

"That's where you're off," the toiler said;

the statesmen wise still pound and

a list of all the laws; I tried it once&mdash;my
mind is wrecked, and now you know the
cause. Some gents who are in prison yet
proclaim with angry shout that they are so
with laws beset, they really can't stay out.
"A man can't walk around a block," I heard
a sad man wail, "but what the cops will
round him flock, and chuck him into jail."
I heard the butcher man repine, and weep,
and rail at fate, because he had to pay a
fine for being short on weight. I heard the
corner grocer snort, and use some language
sour, because they yanked him into court for
selling moldy flour. The milkman bottled
half the creek, and sold it on his route; he
said: "The law just makes me sick," when
friends had bailed him out. The laws are
numerous as scales upon a fish, no doubt;
and so some people are in jails, and simply
can't stay out; but all the time and everywhere
one great truth stands out clear: The
man who acts upon the square, has nothing
much to fear.</p>

face; he scours the slums or moves around
in marble halls, with equal grace; he always
takes some kind of dope or plays the
flute or violin, and when he's billed for
active work he glues false whiskers on his
chin. He always has a Watson near, a tiresome
chump, who sits and broods, the while
the selling-plater sleuth reels off a string of
platitudes. Detective yarns are all so stale!
The plot is evermore the same; we always
have the murdered man, with knives or bullets
in his frame; the pantry window is unlocked;
the safe's been opened with a file;
suspicion shifts until it rests on every man
within a mile; the local peelers blunder
round, and ball things up in frightful shape,
and then the Great Detective comes, with
lens and rule and meas'ring tape; he crawls
around upon the floor, examines all the
water mains, and tastes the ashes in the
stove, and sticks his nose into the drains,
and then he says the problem's solved;
forthwith he spends two weeks or more in
showing Watson and the world how easy
'tis to be a bore!</p>

<h2><a name="Put_It" id="Put_It"></a><i>Put It
On Ice</i></h2>


<p>When you have written a letter
red hot, roasting some chap in his
tenderest spot&mdash;some one who's
done you an underhand trick, some one
who's wounded your pride to the quick;
try to remember that writing abuse does
no more good than the hiss of a goose; this
is the meaning of all of your sass: "You are
a villain&mdash;and I am an ass." Take up your
letter and read it through thrice; put it on
ice awhile, put it on ice! Maybe your wife
isn't much of a cook; maybe she'd rather
sit down with a book, than to go fussing
around making pies, doughnuts and cakes
and things good to your eyes; you are preparing
a withering speech, you are preparing
to rear up and preach, telling your wife
of the beautiful things cooked by your
granny before she had wings; telling your
wife that her duty's to stuff things in your
tummy till it has enough. When you went
courting that hausfrau of yours, swearing
you'd love her while nature endures, did
you get down on your knee-bones and rave:
"Dearest, I'm needing a drudge and a
slave! Come to my cottage and sweep,
cook and scrub! Clean up the dishes and
sweat at the tub!" Can the reproaches
you're planning to make; go to a baker
when spoiling for cake. Cut out the sermon
you think is so nice&mdash;put it on ice
awhile, put it on ice!</p>

<p>"Ten million bones," said good
John Dee, "will reach the Sunny
South from me; this hookworm
scourge, that ruins men, and lays a country
waste again, must be suppressed at any cost&mdash;those
broken men must not be lost! To
make them feel like men once more, to
drive gaunt Famine from their door, to
make them like strong Saxons live, ten million
bones I'll freely give. The victims of
the hookworm scourge, the toilers at the
loom and forge, the humble yeoman at his
plow, may see some ray of comfort now! I
shudder when I read the tales of ruin in
those Southern vales; too tired to do the
simplest chores, men lounge all day about
their doors, and when the sun's low in the
West, the whole caboodle go to rest. And
thus these tillers of the soil burn mighty
little of my oil. When this outrageous
worm decamps, they'll trim the wicks and
light the lamps, and read the books they
have in stock, and all sit up till one o'clock.
The hookworm's acted very mean in shutting
off the kerosene, and so I'll send a good
big roll, to put the blamed thing in the
hole."</p>

<h2><a name="Other_Days" id="Other_Days"></a><i>Other Days</i></h2>


<p>Backward, turn backward, oh time,
in thy flight, feed me on gruel again,
just for tonight; I am so wearied of
restaurant steaks, vitrified doughnuts and
vulcanized cakes, oysters that sleep in a
watery bath, butter as strong as Goliath of
Gath; weary of paying for what I can't eat,
chewing up rubber and calling it meat.
Backward, turn backward, for weary I am!
Give me a whack at my grandmother's jam;
let me drink milk that has never been skimmed,
let me eat butter whose hair has been
trimmed; let me but once have an old-fashioned
pie, then I'll be willing to curl
up and die; I have been eating iron filings
for years&mdash;is it a wonder I'm melting in
tears?</p>

<h2><i>The
Passing
Year</i></h2>


<p>The year's growing ashen, and
weary and gray; full soon he will
cash in, and mosey away. A while
yet he'll totter along to his grave; he's
marked for the slaughter, and nothing can
save. The year that is leaving seems
weighted with woe; and Nature is grieving
because he must go. The forests are
sighing and moaning all day; the night
winds are crying, upon their sad way; the
gray clouds are taking a threatening shape;
the dead grass is shaking like billows of
crape. Dame Nature is tender, and dirges
she'll croon, regretting the splendor and
glory of June; she knows that tomorrow
the old year will sleep; she knows that the
sorrow of parting is deep. In this world,
O never can friends with us stay! Some
loved one forever is going away! And that
is the story of people and years; a morning
of glory, an evening of tears; an hour
of caressing, a call at the dawn, a prayer
and a blessing, and then they are gone.</p>
